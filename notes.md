- If I press '8' on the calculator I expect the '8' to replace the default '0' on the screen

- If I press '8' and then '9' I expect it to be '89'

- If I press the back arrow after two or more numbers are on the scren I expect the screen to delete the last digit on the screen

- If I press the back arrow after only one number is visible on the screen I expect the screen to return to 0
